          <p class="fragment">
            File carving is like piecing together a puzzle by recognizing and
            collecting specific patterns in a vast sea of data. It's a valuable
            technique for situations where traditional recovery methods fall
            short.

            Magic Rescue scans a block device for file types it knows how to

            both as an undelete utility and for recovering a corrupted drive or
            partition. As long as the file data is there, it will find it.

                    Recovering data from SSD is more difficult than it is from HDD, and sometimes it is not
                    possible at all. For instance, when you delete a file on an HDD, the subject file data will
                    not get deleted immediately; instead, the HDD will only delete the pointer to this file,
                    marking its space on the disk as free. The subject file data will get deleted only when the
                    operating system needs to write new data on its location.

                    The SSD uses a different mechanism to handle deleted files; for instance, when
                    a user deletes a file, the SSD will utilize the TRIM command, which works to delete a
                    subject file instantly, leaving its location free for another file to occupy. Each operating
                    system type implements the TRIM command differently: some OS will execute it
                    immediately after a user deletes a file, while others will execute it at regular intervals
